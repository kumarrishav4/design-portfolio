Design is an integral part of our lives, whether we realize it or not. 
It surrounds us in our everyday environments, from the products we use to the buildings we inhabit. 
The purpose of design is to solve problems and improve the quality of life for individuals and society as a whole.
A well-designed product or space not only functions effectively but also evokes emotions and creates a meaningful experience for the user. 
Design is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses various branches, including graphic design, industrial design, interior design, and fashion design,
among others. As a designer, you have the power to influence the way people interact with the world around them, and a portfolio that showcases your
design skills and creativity can demonstrate your ability to make a positive impact through design.
